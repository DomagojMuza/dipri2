    - "\u201CPuts a few gold pieces at table\u201D I am looking for a certain information
      about someone."
    - "It depends about who, that maybe isn\u2019t enough."
    - "Bernet, Johnatan Bernet, navy pirate hunter.\r\nWorker: I know who he is,
      and you should double the coin, any information about the navy isn\u2019t going
      to be cheap."
    - "I\u2019ll triple it, but only if you tell me what I want to know.\r\n"
    - What do you want to know?
    - Tell me everything you know about his ship. How many cannons, speed and maneuverability
      of the ship.
    - "He has a medium sized ship with a lot of cannons, more than 5 on each side,
      and as I heard each of them packs a serious firepower, but slow with poor maneuverability\u2026"
    - "That\u2019s all I wanted, here is your gold, and bring me a bottle of rum."
    - One rum bottle coming.
    - "(So my best strategy is speed and agility, and that means upgrading the ship
      further or just confront him as is. Either way, first I should visit an old
      friend\u2026)"
    - This rum hit me hard, now I'm in a mood to destroy someth... *BURP*
